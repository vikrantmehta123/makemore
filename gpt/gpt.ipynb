    "### Andrej's Notes on Self-Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Attention is just a communication mechanism- not specific to language modeling. You can look at it as a directed graph where each node points to other nodes with which it is communicating, and the weights of those edges? The attention weights! So you can apply attention to ANY directed graph!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. There is no notion of space in attention. Attention simply acts over a set of vectors. So if you have a problem where the sequence is important, then you need to encode the positional information, like we did.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. There is no communication across batches. With the matrix multiplications, the elements within a batch communicate but across batches there is no communication. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Not all tasks require you to have a masked attention. In this task, we wanted to predict the future token and thus we didn't want the tokens to communicate with the future. But let's say your task is sentiment analysis, then there is no need for masking. You will have the entire sentiment with you and you can allow the communication with future tokens also. Without masking the self-attention block is called an \"encoder block\", and with masking it is called the \"decoder block\". Look up Mitesh sir's lectures on Encoder only and Decoder only models. Attention by itself has no notion about which nodes it can communicate with.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Self-attention means that the keys, queries, and values are coming from same source- the input `x`. But there is cross-attention also where the queries come from different source and the keys & values come from an entirely different source, such as an encoder-decoder architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. In the original \"Attention is All You Need\" paper, we have the equation:\n",
    "$softmax(\\dfrac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}})V$. We have done all the matrix multiplication part but there is also `sqrt(head_size)`. The attention is being *scaled* so it's called Scaled attention, and it is to make sure that when the input to Q and K is unit variance, then the `weights` is unit variance too, so as to avoid saturation when being passed through the softmax. So at least at initialization, you want `weights` to avoid taking too extreme values. So when we are doing the `q @ k` matrix multiplication, we need to multiply it by `C ** -0.5`."
